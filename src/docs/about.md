# 👋 About Me

I’m **Alwiest** — a student, builder, and quiet observer of systems.  
Currently shaping ideas in code, design, and the space between them.

## 🧠 What I Care About

- **Simplicity** over complexity  
- **Clarity** over cleverness  
- **Depth** over trends  
- **Intentional work** over busywork

I write code that lasts, interfaces that respect attention, and thoughts that challenge comfort.

## 💻 Currently

- Building personal tools with **Python**, **HTML/CSS**, and plain logic  
- Exploring the philosophy of technology and digital minimalism  
- Writing notes that may one day become something more  
- Learning to balance ambition with peace
